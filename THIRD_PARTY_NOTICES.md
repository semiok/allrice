## DeepSeek Harness

AllRice optionally integrates packages from
[deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness),
licensed under the MIT License. The approved source version, commit and archive
checksum are recorded in `apps/worker/dsh/upstream.json`.

AllRice product identity, multi-tenant authorization and data services are
independent works. The ChatFlow Web surface includes source-derived design
tokens and component styles from the following DeepSeek Harness WebUI paths at
commit `b150a551b8d465e31e418e1b2eaf5e79bbb7d28e`:

- `packages/client/ui-theme/src/styles/*`
- `packages/client/ui-layout/src/client/AppFrame.module.css`
- `packages/client/ui-sidebar/src/client/SidebarRoot.module.css`
- `packages/client/ui-conversation/src/client/**`

The copied files live under `apps/web/app/dsh-upstream` and
`apps/web/app/chatflow/dsh-upstream`. AllRice supplies a SaaS adapter over those
presentation contracts; it does not expose DSH's local single-user connection
or permission model directly to tenants.
